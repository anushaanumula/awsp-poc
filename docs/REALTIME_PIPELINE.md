# Real-Time KPI Streaming

To support live events where immediate visibility is critical, the dashboard can consume KPI updates in real time.

For the demo, the dashboard does not rely on an external backend. Instead it simulates a real-time feed by periodically updating the top KPIs directly in the browser. This keeps the setup lightweight while still illustrating how a low-latency pipeline could deliver actionable metrics during live events.
